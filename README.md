# Tomato-Disease-Detection
Here, I make a machine learning project that detects the disease in Tomato plants.
In this project, I use the CNN-VGG16 model
Tomatoes are one of the most widely grown and consumed crops globally. However, they are easily affected by various diseases, notably grey leaf spot disease, which can lead to significant economic losses by reducing yield and quality. Early detection is crucial for effective management, but traditional methods can be costly and time-consuming, especially on large farms. Therefore, more efficient and cost-effective solutions are needed. This study proposes using image processing techniques to detect disease in tomato leaves, potentially saving time and resources. This project fulfills this solution by using CNN, especially VGG 16.
